Frame and wheel have their corresponding textures.
The stand can be coloured with a diffuse colour of your choice.
Ambient occlusion textures are not mandatory, but you can use them
if you want to achieve nicer looking results.



In 3D computer graphics, modeling, and animation, ambient occlusion is a 
shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point 
in a scene is to ambient lighting. For example, the interior of a tube is 
typically more occluded (and hence darker) than the exposed outer surfaces, 
and becomes darker the deeper inside the tube one goes. Ambient occlusion 
can be seen as an accessibility value that is calculated for each surface point.
In scenes with open sky, this is done by estimating the amount of visible sky 
for each point, while in indoor environments, only objects within a certain 
radius are taken into account and the walls are assumed to be the origin of 
the ambient light. The result is a diffuse, non-directional shading effect 
that casts no clear shadows but that darkens enclosed and sheltered areas 
and can affect the rendered image's overall tone. It is often used as a 
post-processing effect. 
Ambient occlusion is a global method, meaning that the illumination at each 
point is a function of other geometry in the scene.
